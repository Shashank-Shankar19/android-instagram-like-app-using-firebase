# Facebook Automatic Birthday Wisher in Python
This is a python script which takes Email ID and password as input from the user and posts a "Happy Birthday" message on your friend's timeline who have birthday on that day. It uses a python module named "Selenium" and Webdriver_Manager. Make sure you have Selenium and Webdriver_Manager installed and run this file using terminal because getpass may not work on other GUIs. Feel free to contact me for any improvements.
